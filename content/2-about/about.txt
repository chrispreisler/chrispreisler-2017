Copy: My love for design started in the early years of the 21st century when my parents showed me, a 14 years old boy, how to code and design websites. From then I was always curious about creating things and improving my skills. I have been lucky enough to work with many talented people throughout the last years for well-known clients.  Today I can look back on nearly 10 years of design experience and knowledge and would love to share this experience with as much people as possible. In the end, I guess, I simply love what I do.
